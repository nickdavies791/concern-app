                    To make your life easier you can synchronise this application
                    to receive student and staff information from your school's SIMS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In doing so, you can be sure the information in this application
                    is the latest your school has on record.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To sync the data, you will need to authorise this app when it is first
                    installed. This should already have been taken care of but you can contact
                    <a href="mailto:concerns@clpt.co.uk">concerns@clpt.co.uk</a> if you are unsure.
                </p>

                    <strong>Please note:</strong> Data is synced automatically every month, however you can force
                    a sync by using the sync options on the settings page.
